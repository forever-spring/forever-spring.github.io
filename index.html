			<p>When I think of who I am, 2 memories stand out. First goes back to when I was 8 and wrote my first poem, second when I was 14 and my life became about a puzzle.</p>
			<p>My first poem was of course a silly one, but it was a mirror to my thoughts and feelings. I still remember the happiness I felt from seeing my words on the brownish paper of an old notebook.</p>
			<p>At 14, I was given a puzzle not so easy to solve. I was intrigued by it. For 2 weeks, I did not do any homework, I did not study for school, all I did was to try to solve the puzzle; and finally, I did! I had a puzzle and like a dog with a bone, nothing else mattered until I found the answer.</p>
			<p>The satisfaction I had found in creation and in comprehension, has been luring me into fields which promise its continuity.</p>
